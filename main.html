	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science, analyzing the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their running time as the input size grows. It assesses how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. Algorithms with lower time complexity are considered more efficient, as they can handle larger inputs within reasonable time frames. Efficient algorithms are crucial for optimizing computational resources and improving performance in various applications.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b>, often denoted as O(n), evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the input size. It focuses on analyzing how the memory usage of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. Algorithms with lower <b>space complexity</b> are preferred, especially when dealing with large datasets or constrained memory environments. Managing space efficiently ensures that programs can run smoothly without encountering memory limitations or excessive resource consumption. Optimizing space complexity is essential for developing scalable and resource-efficient software solutions</p>
