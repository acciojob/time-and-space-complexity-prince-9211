    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by efficient an algorithm to run as a function.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> , O(n) is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the size of the input. It evaluates how much additional memory.
