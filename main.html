    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It evaluates how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input data. Efficient algorithms are those with low time complexity, meaning they can solve problems quickly even for large input sizes.

        Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the size of the input. It evaluates how much additional memory an algorithm needs relative to the size of the input data. In computational complexity theory, space complexity is often expressed using big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial, especially in resource-constrained environments, as it determines how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory.
